 # DeltaKaggle Credit Applications

This web application is intended for a financial institution to facilitate the acceptance or denial of applications for credit. 
The front end user chooses numeric ranges within a number of variables dictated by a data set with over 100K credit applications. No names are included in the data set(acquired from a kaggle.com competition, now closed). The dataset is instead comprised of basic aspects of personal credit histories(info on delinquencies) and financial circumstances(age, income levels, and number of dependents). The results are returned to the user of the application with numeric ID's for each accepted applicant, as well as statistics related to the overall set of the accepted applications.
